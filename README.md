## Repo Clone and Submission

Please clone this repo (do NOT fork it), and push changes to your own account. Example of process steps linked [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18200248/cloning-a-repo-from-someone-elses-github-and-pushing-it-to-a-repo-on-my-github).

```
- Follow good version control practices.
- An initial commit after cloning the repo, before making any changes.
- Any additional commits you want as you progress through the task.
```

Please push your work to your own github repo and share the link to the project with us, in good time, for review prior to interview. Please expect some questions/technical discussion during the interview, relating to your implementation of the given task.

## Project Requirements / Recommendations

- GitHub Account
- IDE - IntelliJ IDEA
- Defaults to run using Google Chrome, please ensure this is installed
- Maven
- Java 21

## Maven

Open a command/terminal window at the same level as this readme and run:

`cd cucumber-java-selenium`

`./mvn test -DskipTests`

## Run the tests

The runner is available [here](cucumber-java-selenium/src/test/java/io/cucumber/RunCucumberTest.java)

A basic HTML report will be available [here](cucumber-java-selenium/target/cucumber-report/cucumber.html) after a test run.

### Run a subset of Features or Scenarios

The feature file lives [here](cucumber-java-selenium/src/test/resources/io/cucumber/features/theInternet.feature)

You can also specify what to run by *tag*:

    @IncludeTags("ExampleTestTag")

# Required task

There are 3 titled scenarios in the [feature file](cucumber-java-selenium/src/test/resources/io/cucumber/features/theInternet.feature).

Please complete the scenarios to cover the requirements. Feel free to rework/create step definitions, rework/create Page Object Models as you deem appropriate.

Please submit your own code, NOT AI generated solutions to the problem.

### Requirement for Scenario: Basic Auth allows validated access
